### Overview

Within the world data science and analytics there lie a plethora of techniques and strategies at the finger tips of the analyst. Below I will display a few of the more useful techniques I have used working as a scientist and a student. While each dataset holds unique parameters and presenting data in a useful format varies by each audience, using basic datasets should showcase these methods well. As most analysis work is completed on confidential data, many of my professional projects are currently hidden from public view. As such, below please find a sampling of the techniques I have used, but here displayed on public data.

1) Data Breakdown

One of the most important steps in any analysis is to understand the data being analyzed. This includes understanding the dataset itself, the limitations of the data, how it was collected, any biases represented in it, and industry knowledge surrounding it. When first surveying any data, a simple analysis can go a long way in preventing future headache. If one can maintain site of the finish line in a maze, it will be easier to find it when digging among the weeds.

``` {r,warning=F,message=F}

AirQuality <- airquality

head(AirQuality)
str(AirQuality)

AirQuality$Month[!duplicated(AirQuality$Month)]


```

<br>

Here we can see we are dealing with a simple dataframe with four variables and time points for each observations. This is broken into month and day columns. This is good to know because we may want another column set as "Julian Day" to indicate days in a time series, not just within a month.
<br>
Let us look at the breakdown of each element with some basic statistics.

``` {r, warning=F,message=F, fig.align='center'}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

grid.arrange(
  ggplot(data=AirQuality, aes(AirQuality$Ozone)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30, col = "dark blue", fill = "light blue")+
    xlab("Ozone")+
    ylab("Frequency"),
  ggplot(data=AirQuality, aes(AirQuality$Solar.R))+
    geom_histogram(bins = 30, col = "orange", fill = "gold")+
    xlab("Solar Radiation") +
    ylab(""),
  ggplot(data=AirQuality, aes(AirQuality$Wind))+
    geom_histogram(bins = 30, col = "dark gray", fill = "light gray")+
    xlab("Wind Speed")+
    ylab("Frequency"),
  ggplot(data=AirQuality, aes(AirQuality$Temp))+
    geom_histogram(bins = 30, col = "dark red", fill = "red")+
    xlab("Temperature")+
    ylab(""),
  nrow=2,
  ncol=2)

```

<br>

##### Solar Radiation

``` {r, warning=F,message=F, fig.align='center'}

hist((AirQuality %>% count(Solar.R))$Solar.R, breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Solar Radiation Data", xlab = "")

```

<br>

##### Wind

``` {r, warning=F,message=F, fig.align='center'}

hist((AirQuality %>% count(Wind))$Wind, breaks = 8, main = "Histogram of Wind Data", xlab = "")

```

<br>

##### Temperature

``` {r, warning=F,message=F, fig.align='center'}

hist((AirQuality %>% count(Temp))$Temp, breaks = 3, main = "Histogram of Temperature Data", xlab = "")

```
